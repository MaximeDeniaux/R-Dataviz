# R-Dataviz

You will find dataviz created with R. <br>
Some are interactive (.html) but visible only on my [website](https://www.sport-with-r.com/) (because here in static form). <br>
Most of the time the script is given. If this is not the case, it is because it is no longer usable for various reasons (for example data scraping which is no longer possible due to a change of website such as [ATP](https://www.atptour.com/en) for example).
